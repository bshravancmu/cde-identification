Steps - for a given financial regulation

   Prompt: Analyze this MTRS regulatory text, identify, and summarize the data required for reporting, define data elements. Give me a simple list with one line definition, make sure to include the all data elements for debt securities

b) Given a trade dataset in a bank, come up with a data dictionary â€“ standardized names (possibly aligning to standard such as ISDA CDM or FpML) and definition. 

c) Match the regulatory data requirement with the data dictionary and provide a detailed analysis of useful data, gaps, risks etc.
